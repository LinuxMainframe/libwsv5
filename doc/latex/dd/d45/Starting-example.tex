Start recording to disk.

Start recording to disk.\+Tells OBS to begin recording the current scene and audio to the configured output file (usually somewhere in your Videos folder). This is separate from streaming -\/ you can record without streaming, stream without recording, or do both.

The actual file path is configured in OBS settings -\/ this library doesn\textquotesingle{}t control where the file goes or what format it uses. Those are OBS preferences.

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
OBSWS\+\_\+\+OK if request sent successfully (doesn\textquotesingle{}t mean recording started yet) 

OBSWS\+\_\+\+ERROR\+\_\+\+NOT\+\_\+\+CONNECTED if not connected
\end{DoxyReturn}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This is async -\/ function returns immediately, recording starts in background. 

You\textquotesingle{}ll get a Recording\+State\+Changed event when recording actually starts. 

If recording is already running, OBS ignores this request (no error). 

The recorded file format depends on OBS configuration (usually MP4 or MKV).
