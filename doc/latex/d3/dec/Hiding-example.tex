\hypertarget{Hiding-example}{}\doxysection{Hiding}
Set whether a source is visible in a scene.

Set whether a source is visible in a scene.\+Sources are the building blocks of scenes -\/ they can be cameras, images, text, browser windows, etc. Each source appears in one or more scenes, and you can control whether it\textquotesingle{}s shown or hidden. When you hide a source, it doesn\textquotesingle{}t render on the stream/recording until you show it again.

This is useful for\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Show/hide a watermark or banner
\item Toggle overlays on and off
\item Control which camera appears (if you have multiple cameras as sources)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note\+: A source can exist in multiple scenes. Changing visibility in one scene doesn\textquotesingle{}t affect it in other scenes.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em conn} & Connection handle (must be in CONNECTED state) \\

\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
OBSWS\+\_\+\+OK if request sent successfully 

OBSWS\+\_\+\+ERROR\+\_\+\+NOT\+\_\+\+CONNECTED if not connected 

OBSWS\+\_\+\+ERROR\+\_\+\+INVALID\+\_\+\+PARAM if scene\+\_\+name or source\+\_\+name is NULL
\end{DoxyReturn}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
If the scene or source doesn\textquotesingle{}t exist, OBS returns an error in response.
