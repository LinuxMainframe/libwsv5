\hypertarget{Switching-example}{}\doxysection{Switching}
Switch to a specific scene in OBS.

Switch to a specific scene in OBS.\+This tells OBS to make a different scene active. When you switch scenes, all sources in the new scene become visible (if their visibility is on), and sources from the old scene disappear. This is the main way to change what\textquotesingle{}s being streamed or recorded.

Switching scenes is fast but not instant -\/ OBS processes the request and sends a Scene\+Changed event when complete. If you have many sources with animations, the transition might take a second or so.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em conn} & Connection handle (must be in CONNECTED state) \\
\hline
{\em scene\+\_\+name} & Name of the scene to activate (must exist in OBS, case-\/sensitive) \\
\hline
{\em response} & Optional pointer to receive response. If you pass a pointer to response pointer, you get back a response object that you must free with \mbox{\hyperlink{library_8h_a53067e61dc0ddcf1134d46b275d7ce6b}{obsws\+\_\+response\+\_\+free()}}. Pass NULL if you don\textquotesingle{}t care about the response. \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
OBSWS\+\_\+\+OK if the request was sent successfully (doesn\textquotesingle{}t mean OBS processed it yet) 

OBSWS\+\_\+\+ERROR\+\_\+\+NOT\+\_\+\+CONNECTED if not connected 

OBSWS\+\_\+\+ERROR\+\_\+\+INVALID\+\_\+\+PARAM if scene\+\_\+name is NULL
\end{DoxyReturn}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The scene must exist in OBS. If you try to switch to a non-\/existent scene, OBS will return an error in the response. 

This is async -\/ the function returns before OBS actually switches scenes. Watch for a Scene\+Changed event to know when it completed. 

If you only care about success/failure, you can pass NULL for response. 

The response contains OBS status codes -\/ 100-\/199 is success, 600+ is error.
