Get the name of the currently active scene.

Get the name of the currently active scene.\+Asks OBS which scene is currently shown. The answer comes back as a string that you provide a buffer for. If the buffer is too small, the function fails with OBSWS\+\_\+\+ERROR\+\_\+\+RECV\+\_\+\+FAILED (or similar) because the response doesn\textquotesingle{}t fit.

This is useful to check what scene is active before switching, or to sync your UI state with OBS (in case OBS was controlled by something else).


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em conn} & Connection handle (must be in CONNECTED state) \\
\hline
{\em scene\+\_\+name} & Output buffer where the scene name will be written \\
\hline
{\em buffer\+\_\+size} & Size of the buffer (how many bytes can fit) \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
OBSWS\+\_\+\+OK on success 

OBSWS\+\_\+\+ERROR\+\_\+\+NOT\+\_\+\+CONNECTED if not connected 

OBSWS\+\_\+\+ERROR\+\_\+\+INVALID\+\_\+\+PARAM if scene\+\_\+name is NULL
\end{DoxyReturn}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The buffer should be large enough for typical scene names. OBS doesn\textquotesingle{}t limit scene name length, but practically they\textquotesingle{}re usually under 256 characters. 256 or 512 bytes is usually safe. 

The string written to scene\+\_\+name is null-\/terminated. 

This is synchronous -\/ it waits for response before returning (blocking).
