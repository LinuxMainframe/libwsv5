 * OBS WebSocket v5 Protocol Library

 *

 * - Scene switching and control
 * - Connection health monitoring
 * - Thread-safe operations
 * - Multiple concurrent connections support

 * Error codes returned by library functions.
 * 
 * These error codes provide detailed information about what went wrong during
 * library operations. Unlike generic error codes, they help distinguish between
 * different failure modes so you can implement proper error handling and recovery
 * strategies. For example, OBSWS_ERROR_TIMEOUT means you should probably retry
 * the operation, while OBSWS_ERROR_AUTH_FAILED means retrying won't help - the
 * password is just wrong.
 * 
 * The library uses negative error codes following POSIX conventions. Zero is always
 * success. This makes it easy to check errors with simple conditions like if (error < 0).
 * 
 * Note that some errors are recoverable (network timeouts, temporary connection
 * failures) while others are not (invalid parameters, authentication failure).
 * The auto-reconnect feature only applies to network-level errors, not application
 * errors like wrong scene names.

 * 
 * Switching scenes is fast but not instant - OBS processes the request and sends

 * @return OBSWS_OK if the request was sent successfully (doesn't mean OBS processed it yet)
 * @return OBSWS_ERROR_NOT_CONNECTED if not connected
 * @return OBSWS_ERROR_INVALID_PARAM if scene_name is NULL
 * 
 * @note The scene must exist in OBS. If you try to switch to a non-existent scene,
